Instructions to execute the program:


* Extract the folder.


* Make sure you have inp-params.txt file to give input to program. A sample file has been give in the folder.


* Compile the normal vector clock using :  
g++ VC-CS16BTECH11036.cpp -o VC-CS16BTECH11036 -std=c++11 -lpthread


* Run using : 
./VC-CS16BTECH11036




* Compile the Singhal-Kshemkalyani optimization using : 
g++ SK-CS16BTECH11036.cpp -o SK-CS16BTECH11036 -std=c++11 -lpthread


* Run using : 
./SK-CS16BTECH11036


* You can see two output files named output-vc.txt, output-SK.txt are created. One has output of normal VC while other has output for Singhal-Kshemkalyani optimization.


* One output file names comparison.txt will be formed which shows the comparison between two algorithms.
